## Howdy ðŸ‘‹

I am a developer on my coding journey.

Here, you will find my projects and experiments as I learn and grow in my skills.

I am currently working on understanding and utilizing HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I'm also working on understanding principles of backend development.

I hope you find my progress interesting.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any opportunities!
